# Todo List
This project is a simple React application for managing a to-do list. 
The main component, `TodoWrapper`, handles the creation, display, and management of to-do items. 
Additionally, the app uses the `react-hot-toast` library to display toast notifications for user actions like adding or completing tasks. 
The application structure is clean and minimal, focusing on delivering a straightforward task management experience.
